Q1:Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly
statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?

A1:As observed from the graphs, as K-mer increases the size of assembly increases. This is because large kmers resolve ambiguity while building 
consensus to construct an assembly. Smaller kmers cause problems in noisy regions.

The  N50 improves and average contig length also increases but the mean depth of coverage decreases.


Q2:How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening to the
de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does velvet
calculate its value for ‘auto’?

A2:As the coverage cutoff increases,the assembly size decreases. This is because with the increase in coverage cutoff value, 
velvet discards the contigs that do not have set coverage value.
For example,if the value is 20, if the coverage for a particular contig is below 20, it discards that contig.

Velvet automatically calculates its value for auto by performing many runs in parallel, checking the statistics of each run and then choosing the best one.

Q3:How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and
N50?
A3:By specifying minimum contig length Velvet ensures that there are no contigs that have length < then the desired length.
Hence the number of nucleotide decreases as the contigs below the set level are discarded.
N50 value also increases as there more contigs with longer size.
